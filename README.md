# JomexOS

🚀 **A Bio-Inspired, Post-Quantum Secure Operating System**  
Designed with **Active Inference**, **Stigmergic Governance**, and **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Sovereignty**.

---

## 🌍 Vision
JomexOS is not just another operating system.  
It is a **sovereign, community-driven ecosystem** designed for resilience, adaptability, and trust in the post-quantum era.

Our mission is to **redefine digital trust** by merging insights from neuroscience, distributed intelligence, and advanced cryptography.

---

## 🔬 Core Principles
1. **Bio-Inspired Design** – Guided by the Free Energy Principle.  
2. **Stigmergic Active Inference Governance (SAIG)** – Decentralized coordination via emergent intelligence.  
3. **Post-Quantum Security** – PQC and ZKP protocols integrated at every layer.
